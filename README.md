### Sample project with Clean Model (Unidirectional data flow)

Implemented with [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift)

**Why Redux??**
- Model (data) is a separated module
- Modularized (actions, reducers, state)
- Easy to test
- Data (state) centered
- Data (state) is up-to-date in the whole app "automatically". We don't have to emit events about changes or listen to changes in DataBase.
